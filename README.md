# MyReads App
My challenge was to make MyReads App - A book tracking app with Reject library.
It is a web-based application app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

I've used the [React](hhttps://reactjs.org/) library as required.

## index.html & style.css
Simple HTML and CSS code to support App's UI.

## app.js
- included and managed Book API to prepare the search view
- handled onChange event
- render main components

## Components
- Bookshelf
- Book
- SearchResults 
- SearchResultsWrapper
- Library

### Getting started
```sh
$ npm install 
$ npm start
```

### Tech

Web-based application.

* [Reject](https://reactjs.org/) library to create interactive UI.
* [Udacity's book API] - to load books in the library

### Contributing
Project requirements were written as part of Reject nanodegree program project submission. I used the starter code for the template, the focus of this project is on writing functional React code.
